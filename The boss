1. **System schema (data model)**
2. **Core API endpoints** (REST style, easy to extend)
3. **External integrations** you might want (Google Calendar, WhatsApp, AI APIs)

---

## 1. Schema (Data Model)

Here’s a simplified version you can expand later (SQL/NoSQL friendly).

### **User**

* `id` (UUID)
* `name`
* `email`
* `password_hash` (if not using Google Auth)
* `auth_provider` (local, google)
* `created_at`

### **Profile**

* `user_id` (FK → User)
* `goals` (array of `Goal`)
* `boss_type` (enum: default, funny, serious, minion)
* `preferences` (JSON: notification time, integrations, etc.)

### **Goal**

* `id`
* `user_id` (FK → User)
* `title`

## 2. API Endpoints (Draft)

* `PUT /profile` – update profile (goals, boss type, preferences)
* `POST /goals` – create a goal
* `GET /goals` – list goals
* `GET /goals/:id` – get goal details
* `PUT /goals/:id` – update goal
* `DELETE /goals/:id` – delete goal

**Tasks**

* `POST /tasks` – create task (manual or AI suggested)
* `GET /tasks` – list all tasks (filter: goal, status)
* `PUT /tasks/:id` – update task (mark complete, edit)
* `DELETE /tasks/:id` – delete task

**Journal**

---

## 3. Integrations

* **Google Calendar API** → sync tasks with events.
* **WhatsApp Business API** → send boss-style notifications.
* **AI API** (OpenAI / Gemini / Claude / Comet) →

  * Summarize journals
  * Generate tasks from thesis/goals
  * Analyze productivity patterns
  * Act as “Boss persona” in chat

---

⚡ Example Flow:

1. User logs in → sets profile + goals.
2. AI asks clarifying questions (“What’s your thesis?”).
3. AI generates **initial tasks** → pushes to calendar.
4. Daily journal check-in → AI analyzes → logs success/failures.
5. Boss persona pings via WhatsApp → “Why aren’t you on task?”
6. User checks dashboard → calendar, tasks, journal, team view.

👉 Do you want me to **draft this as OpenAPI (Swagger spec)** so you can plug it straight into a backend framework, or keep it high-level REST like above?

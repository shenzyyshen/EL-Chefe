 Flow:

1. User logs in → sets profile + goals.
2. AI asks clarifying questions (“What’s your goals?”).
3. AI generates **initial tasks** → pushes to calendar.
4. Daily journal check-in → AI analyzes → logs success/failures.
5. Boss persona pings via WhatsApp → “Why aren’t you on task?”
6. User checks dashboard → calendar, tasks, journal, team view.
